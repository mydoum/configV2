My Dotfiles
===========

Everything I need to get setup on a new machine. Currently working with

* OSX

## What's here

* **script/setup/** - Scripts that configure new computers (currently only osx) from scratch.
  These scripts perform such tasks as:
    * osx.sh:
        * Insalling [Homebrew][1] & associated packages
        * Installing mac applications using [Homebrew Cask][2]
